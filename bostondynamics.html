                <h2>Atlas</h2>
                <p>Atlas is the latest in a line of advanced humanoid robots Boston Dynamics are developing. Atlas' control system coordinates motions of the arms, torso and legs to achieve whole-body mobile manipulation, greatly expanding its reach and workspace.  Atlas' ability to balance while performing tasks allows it to work in a large volume while occupying only a small footprint.    The Atlas hardware takes advantage of 3D printing to save weight and space, resulting in a remarkable compact robot with high strength-to-weight ratio and a dramatically large workspace.  Stereo vision, range sensing and other sensors give Atlas the ability to manipulate objects in its environment and to travel on rough terrain. Atlas keeps its balance when jostled or pushed and can get up if it tips over.</p>

                <h2>Mini Spot</h2>
                <p>SpotMini is a small four-legged robot that comfortably fits in an office or home.  It weighs 25 kg (30 kg if you include the arm). SpotMini is all-electric and can go for about 90 minutes on a charge, depending on what it is doing.  SpotMini is the quietest robot Boston Dynamics have built. SpotMini inherits all of the mobility of its bigger brother, Spot, while adding the ability to pick up and handle objects using its 5 degree-of-freedom arm and beefed up perception sensors. The sensor suite includes stereo cameras, depth cameras, an IMU, and position/force sensors in the limbs.  These sensors help with navigation and mobile manipulation.</p>
